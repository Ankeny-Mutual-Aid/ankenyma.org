                <h2>Who Are We</h2>
                <p>We are a collective of neighbors in Ankeny, Iowa, that work to better ourselves and our community through mutual aid. Whenever there's a need in our community, it is our goal to be able to help.</p>

                <h2>What Do We Do</h2>
                <p>We help our neighbors. AMA, like mutual aid, isn't limited by scope to one project or mission. Wherever there's a need in our community, we aim to be there.</p>
                <p>With that being said, here's some things we want to be involved with as a group. If you'd like to get involved or take the lead on other projects, let us know.</p>
                <p><i class="light">housing projects for those without homes, free food, free lawn care, guerilla gardening, trail maintenance, free clothing, vehicle maintenance, ride sharing, walking buddies, community defense, disaster response, free education, free gyms, book clubs, etc...</i></p>

                <h2>What Do We Believe</h2>
                <p>AMA at it's heart is an anarchist collective with the goal of cultivating mutual aid in our community. To know what we believe, it's important to understand "anarchism".</p>
                <p><b>What is Anarchism?</b></p>
                <p><i>a political theory advocating the abolition of hierarchical government and the organization of society on a voluntary, cooperative basis without recourse to force or compulsion.</i> - Oxford</p>
                <p>For us, "anarchism" is about freedom, loving one another, voluntary and free association and fighting against inequality, injustice, oppression and hate. The most direct way for us to work towards our goals is to help each other because that's what it's about anyways, no matter what state/government/organization is in control.</p>
                <p>We believe that by helping each other we make our community better and provide a vehicle for change that doesn't rely on non-profits, companies, governments, taxes, politicians or votes. It's about doing what you can with what you have. That's enough.</p>
