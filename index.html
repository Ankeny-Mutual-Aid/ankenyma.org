                <h2>Who Are We</h2>
                <p>We are a collective of neighbors in Ankeny, Iowa, that work to better ourselves and our community through mutual aid. Whenever there's a need in our community, it is our goal to be able to help.</p>

                <h2>What Do We Do</h2>
                <p>We help our neighbors. AMA, like mutual aid, isn't limited by scope to one project or mission. Wherever there's a need in our community, we aim to be there.</p>
                <p>With that being said, here's some things we want to be involved with as a group. If you'd like to get involved or take the lead on other projects, let us know.</p>
                <p><i class="light">housing projects for those without homes, free food, free lawn care, guerilla gardening, trail maintenance, free clothing, vehicle maintenance, ride sharing, walking buddies, community defense, disaster response, free education, free gyms, book clubs, etc...</i></p>

                <h2>What Do We Believe</h2>
                <p>AMA at it's heart is an anarchist collective with the goal of cultivating mutual aid in our community. To know what we believe, it's important to understand what "mutual aid" and "anarchism" really is.</p>

                <p><b>What is Anarchism?</b></p>
                <p><i>a political theory advocating the abolition of hierarchical government and the organization of society on a voluntary, cooperative basis without recourse to force or compulsion.</i> - Oxford</p>
                <p>For us, "anarchism" is about freedom, loving one another, voluntary and free association and fighting against inequality, injustice, oppression and hate. The most direct way for us to work towards our goals is to help each other because that's what it's about anyways, no matter what state/government/organization is in control.</p>
                <p>We believe that by helping each other we make our community better and provide a vehicle for change that doesn't rely on non-profits, companies, governments, taxes, politicians or votes. It's about doing what you can with what you have. That's enough.</p>

                <hr>

                <p><b>What is Mutual Aid?</b></p>
                <p>Mutual Aid is the voluntary cooperation of individuals for a common goal. It's not charity, it's solidarity. Everyone can provide <i>something</i> and everyone need's <i>something else</i>. Mutual Aid is about coming together as a community, giving help, receiving it and working together outside of any corrupt and exploitative systems.</p>
                <p>Let's say I have a lawn mower and you have a tomato garden. We could come to an agreement that I'd help you with your lawn and you'd share some of the delicious tomatoes. It's important to note it's not necessarily just about trading one thing for another but coming together and helping and sharing to build a stronger community.</p>
                <p>We never try to place weight or numbers on what is given to compare contributions. Give what you can, take what you need. It's that simple.</p>

                <hr>

                <p><b>So what do we believe?</b></p>
                <p>We believe that we need a society that rids itself of corruption and exploitation. Where free people can come together and live in a world where we're not struggling and suffering daily. We want to see a world where people are happy and fulfilled, where we love instead of hate.</p>
                <p>We believe that Mutual Aid is how our society should be structured at the lowest level. "Neighbors helping neighbors". No one should be kept awake at night worrying about how they'll get their next meal or if they'll be able to keep the lights on, nor wonder where they'll sleep at night. No one should be forced to work throughout the day, every day to line the pockets of another while they miss out on raising their children or spending time with their loved ones. No one should have to be tormented and abused by an exploitative system, it's enforcers or hate groups. We're all here, on earth, doing our best. If we work together it's possible to see this type of world materialize right in front of us, today.</p>
